# Bot-In-Telegram-App
The aim of this project is to develop a Telegram Bot that serves as a daily expense manager and records day-to-day events like a diary. To achieve this, we utilized the BotFather API to generate a token, allowing us to access the HTTP API. We also used Libcurl and JSON to create objects and MakeFile or Cmake to compile the logic.
